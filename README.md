# js-event-is-easy

## Why is this built?
I am a self-taught frontend engineer that started since 2022. I came up with the idea to build an application to better learn the Javascript events because I am somewhat struggled to understand it. There are not many interactive resources as of today (Mar 5 2023) so it may be good to build one to help myself and also the others who have the same problem as I do.

## What do I expect?
I have never got serious to build something so this may be a good opportunity for me to start.
\
As a beginner in the industry, I am always amazed by how people connecting on Github and making contributions to each other. This inspired me to challenge myself to be one of those amazing people.
\
Hopefully, this can attract more people join and improve it just like how the other projects do so that I can learn to build a real project and collaborate with different people around the globe.
